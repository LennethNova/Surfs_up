# Surf's Up

## Overview of Project
Based on the information provided, there is a need to analyze the information in order to get the best possible result in order to select the best possible outcomes based on the months and also the stations near the surfing spots.

### This project includes:
- Temperature data for the months of June
- Temperature data for the months of December

### Purpose
There is a need to gather information for specific trends considering the possible best month to surf, and also the possible worst weather in order to consider further development of the possible opening of a new shop.

## Analysis and Challenges
The first challenge to accomplish was to make sure that the proper month was documented accordingly and gather information using measurements such as mean, average, etc.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on June and December
Based on the information gathered and according to it, during June the average temperature is 74°F while in December is 71°C. Those temperatures are comfortable for surfing and also nice in order to have some cold snacks. Also near the Station with the Id: USC00519281 is a good spot, but is critical to check the proximity to the beach in order to give it a go.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The principal challenge was to make the code display the information needed and learn to use the extract in a proper way.

## Results

- The minimum temperature in december is colder than in june and that can make people to consider other options to do during that month.

- Fortunately, both months seem to be nice in order to get some cold snacks, but perhaps because of the minimum weather during december, the ice cream sales will drop. It would be important to consider to also sell energetic drinks, water and other beverages.

- June would be perfect for a trip due to the weather, and also it can be nice to travel to Hawaii during this time in order to relax from school and work with no mayor events (except for the ones that can be for tourist attraction).
